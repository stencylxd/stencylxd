# [a website](https://www.stencylxd.github.io/website)
This is a website that I built to host my stuff.<br>
<br>I used:
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (speeds it up and also free ssl)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (because every other hosting service costs money)
- [ASP.NET C#](https://asp.net) (for the entire website code)
