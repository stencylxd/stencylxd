# [a website](https://www.stencylxd.github.io/website)
This is a website that I built to host my stuff.<br>
<br>I used:
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) (speeds it up and also free ssl)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (because every other hosting service costs money)
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (markup for the website)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (style for the website)
